# simple-ansible-mysql

Hi, this is my simple ansible mysql role. With this role in your playbook you can simply install, configure and manage a mysql/mariadb server.
This role is compatible with the following Linux Distributions:

* Debian (>7)
* Ubuntu (>14.04)
* CentOS (>6.7)

## Configuration / Usage

The role will automatically chose the platform specific install and configuration files. Each platform has its own set of variables set in the vars.yml under the vars section. With the examples included, it will automatically create two database users each with a database assigned (IÂ´ve put this in for a better understanding of the variables/usage of the variables)
